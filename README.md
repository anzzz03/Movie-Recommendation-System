# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content based recommendation system which uses the 'Bag of Words' technique for the process of Text Vectorization which converts each of the 5000 movies in the Kaggle TMDB 5000 Movie dataset to a unique vector. The model then uses various tags such as Director, Cast, Genres etc. to recommend top 10 movies which are similar to the movie inputted by the user. Streamlit, an open-source Python library to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science, was used to build and deploy the recommendation system app.
