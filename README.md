# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content based recommendation system which uses the 'Bag of Words' technique for the process of text vectorization, converting each of the 5000 movies in the Kaggle TMDB 5000 movie dataset into unique vectors. Leveraged key features such as director, cast, and genre to recommend the top 10 movies similar to the movie inputted by the user. Built and deployed the recommendation system app using Streamlit, an open-source Python library for creating custom web applications in Machine Learning and Data Science.
