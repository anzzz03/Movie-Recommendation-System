# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content based recommendation system which uses the "Bag of Words" technique for the process of Text Vectorization which converts each of the 5000 movies in the Kaggle dataset to a unique vector. The model then uses various tags such as Director, Cast, Genres etc. to recommend top 10 movies which are similar to the movie inputted by the user.
